### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Xinan

I'm studying Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I've previously interned at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg), [Generation Lab](https://www.generationlab.org/), and [Motiva AI](https://www.motiva.ai/). I've also built deep learning tooling for autonomous UAVs at the [Johns Hopkins Institue for Assured Autonomy](https://iaa.jhu.edu/). 

Through my internships and independent projects, I've honed my problem-solving skills across full-stack development, working with LLMs, cloud infrastructure-as-code, and systems development. I'm actively looking for internships and new grad opportunities, and am excited to contribute in fast-paced, collaborative teams.
