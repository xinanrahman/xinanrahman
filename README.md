### Hey 👋, I'm Xinan

I'm studying Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I've previously interned at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg), [Generation Lab](https://www.generationlab.org/), and [Motiva AI](https://www.motiva.ai/). I've also built deep learning tooling for autonomous UAVs at the [Johns Hopkins Institue for Assured Autonomy](https://iaa.jhu.edu/). 

This summer, I'll be at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/)!
